Folder structure:
- ./res:        ressources provided by the lecture
- ./out:        files generated by scripts i.e. measurement and simulation data/results
- ./animations: animations for each task. also include a png-File representing the laast frame of the animation

Scripts:
- Task2.py:           upwind advection scheme including plot generation for Task2
- misc.py:            miscellaneous global variables related to the project
- animate.py:         script that creates an animation for a given data file
- task1_1.py:         script that creates output file for task1_1
- task1_2.py:         script that creates output file for task1_2
- task1.3.py:         using an implicit solver of first order (produce plots by uncommenting the commands in the last part of the script)
- task1.4.py:         using an implicit solver of second order (produce plots by uncommenting the commands in the last part of the script)
- plot.py:            script that creates plots
- run.sh:             shellscript to run different settings and create output
- task1_functions.py  functions used in task1_1.py and task1_2.py

Usage Info:
- task1_1.py and task1_2.py have 5 input arguments:
task1_X.py [-h] [Nx] [deltat] [num_iter] [printmod] [filename]

positional arguments:
  Nx          Number of grid points
  deltat      timestep
  num_iter    number of total timesteps performed
  printmod    modulo for creating smaller files for animation, 1 is fine  
  filename    name of output file 

- To create all plots from Task1_1 and Task1_2:
  ./run.sh
  python3 plot.py
